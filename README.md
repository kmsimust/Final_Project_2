    3. The Answer

        1. What mistake did you make?
            I didn't properly give credit to the owner of the in-game sprite that I use.

        2. Why is it an ethics problem that you did not refer to or clarify which part you took from other work?
            It's like stealing and impersonation from the real owner of these arts.

        3. What can you do to fix the mistake?
            Properly give the credits to the owner of the arts and its artist.
